# PIM

Works only on Windows for now.

It's a very simple note board. You open the app. Double click anywhere blank and enter in your note in the prompt window. Save and close and your note is on the board.

Click back anytime to see your note or update/delete it. Drag/drop to replace it on your board.

On prompt window, you can cipher/decipher your notes with a key.

Stores data in local text file next to the app itself.
